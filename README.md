Running the project using Docker
--------------------------------

You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system. After installing these tools, you can run the project from the terminal by navigating to the project directory and executing the following commands:

* `docker-compose build`
* `docker-compose up`

Open a new terminal and run these two:

* `docker-compose run rsvpapp bundle exec rake db:create`
* `docker-compose run rsvpapp bundle exec rake db:migrate`

After your project is set up, you only need to execute `docker-compose up` the next time you want to run it again.
